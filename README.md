Yumnak 🤟
Yumnak is a smart mobile application designed to facilitate communication between Deaf individuals and Sign Language Interpreters through a simple, secure, and accessible technical platform.
The app allows users to create profiles, browse interpreters, and communicate directly, aiming to reduce communication barriers and promote digital inclusion.
📱 Project Overview
Deaf individuals often face daily challenges in communication, especially in situations where qualified sign language interpreters are required quickly.
Yumnak acts as a technical bridge:
