# Yumnak 🤟

**Yumnak** is a smart application designed to facilitate communication between deaf people and sign language interpreters through a safe and simple platform that allows account creation, profile viewing, and direct interaction between both parties.

## 📱 Project Idea

Deaf people face daily communication challenges, especially in situations that require qualified sign language interpreters quickly. **Yumnak** provides a technological bridge:

* Between **deaf individuals** who need sign language interpreters
* And **sign language interpreters** looking for flexible job opportunities

> The app works only as a communication platform and does not provide direct translation services.
